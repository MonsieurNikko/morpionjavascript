# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in JavaScript

This project represents my initial foray into JavaScript. It's a straightforward implementation of the timeless Tic-Tac-Toe game playable within a web browser.

## How to Play

1. Open the `morpion.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. The game takes place on a 3x3 grid.
3. Each player selects a symbol: either "X" or "O".
4. Players alternate turns to place their chosen symbol into an empty cell on the grid.
5. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
6. If the grid is completely filled without a winning alignment, the game is declared a draw.

## Game Features

- **Simple User Interface**: The user interface is user-friendly and intuitive, enabling players to click on cells to place their symbol.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically identifies when a player has aligned three of their symbols and announces the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: If the grid is filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.

## Update v0.1

- **Start Button Enhancement**: The start button has been updated to provide a smoother gaming experience. It now triggers the game directly upon clicking, removing the need for an additional step.
- **Win/Draw Interface Improvement**: The interface for displaying the game result (win or draw) has been revamped for better clarity and visual appeal. Now, upon the end of the game, the result is prominently displayed, making it easier for players to see the outcome.
