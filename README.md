# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in JavaScript

This project is my first venture into JavaScript. It's a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played in a web browser.

## How to Play

1. Open the `morpion.html` file in your web browser.
2. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
3. Each player selects a symbol, either "X" or "O".
4. Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell on the grid.
5. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
6. If the grid is filled without any player achieving a winning alignment, the game is declared a draw.

## Game Features

- **Simple User Interface**: The user interface is user-friendly and intuitive, allowing players to click on cells to place their symbol.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has aligned three of their symbols and announces the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: If the grid is filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
